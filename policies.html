          <ul><li> Under the new scheme, the farmers' premium has been kept at a maximum of 2 per cent for foodgrains and oilseeds, and up to 5 per cent for horticulture and cotton crops.
</li> <li>There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government. Earlier, there was a provision of capping the premium rate which resulted in low claims being paid to farmers. This capping was done to limit Government outgo on the premium subsidy. This capping has now been removed and farmers will get claim against full sum insured without any reduction.>/li>
<li> Importantly for the beneficiaries, crop losses which are covered under the scheme include Yield Losses as well as post-harvest losses, where coverage will be available up to a maximum period of 14 days from harvesting for those crops.</li><li> The use of technology will be encouraged to a great extent resulting in operational efficiency. Smart phones will be used to capture and upload data of crop cutting to reduce the delays in claim payment to farmers. Remote sensing will be used to reduce the number of crop cutting experiments.</li></ul>
